sentence=TC3, TC4 or TC5 timer library for SAMD21 microcontrollers.
paragraph=This library allows using the TC3_Handler, TC4_Handler and the TC5_Handler routine triggered by the TC3, TC4 or TC5 timer on SAMD21 (e. g. Arduino MKRZERO). It is possible to trigger very fast (a few microseconds, e. g. 4 us and less, depending on the runtime of the handler routine/function). You can use fraction numbers as interval (e. g. 2.5 us). Keep in mind, TC4 and TC5 are not completely independent.
